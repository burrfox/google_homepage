This project was created to look roughly like Google's homepage. I have just recently began learning to code and this is my first project from The Odin Project. I created this using the HTMl and CSS languages linked on seperate pages. My HTML page uses basic formatting and elements such as lists, images, links, buttons, classes, and such. The CSS page is where I formatted, styled, and positioned all of my page elements such as fonts, backgrounds, dimensions, placments, and etc. The goal of this project was not for the page to be an exact replica but to be an introduction into coding with HTML and CSS on my own.
